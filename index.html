        <h2>weekly D</h2>
        <div class="teal-box">
            <p class="groove">After studying this week, we learned more about the instructions related to CSS. I think the most interesting thing is that we shared five different styles of typesetting assignments for poetry production. I have experienced everyone's different creativity towards the same topic assignment. This is very interesting for me. The one that left a deep impression on me was the 'tiger'. This student used Pre's tag to arrange the text of the poem in the shape of a tiger, which is very interesting and I think it is difficult and time-consuming. Not only does using text to create graphics make me feel interesting, but his homepage is also very interesting. A huge tiger's title is in the middle of the screen, with four little tiger logos in the four corners of the title. I think it's very simple, atmospheric, and cute. I really enjoy watching other people's creativity, which is very interesting and can bring me a lot of inspiration and inspiration. Looking forward to future assignments.
