            <p class="groove">This week, I feel like my luck is a bit off. I broke my own ceramic work. That day, my spirit was very exhausted. After making the decorative parts of one of my current bottle works, I planned to put all my things back. After I put my bottle artwork back in my storage compartment, I reached out to retrieve a ball shaped ceramic I had previously made. But during the process, I accidentally knocked over my bottle, so I quickly went to straighten it. Then my demon fruit fell to the ground and shattered. To this day, I still feel sad about it.
